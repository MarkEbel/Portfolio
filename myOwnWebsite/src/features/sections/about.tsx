      <p>I'm a software developer with a strong backend foundation in C# and PHP, currently expanding my expertise in React.js and TypeScript. I thrive on solving complex problems and building scalable, high-performance applications that prioritize both functionality and maintainability. 
        My experience spans a variety of problems, from building robust APIs for complex environments to adopting new technologies to streamline workflows. I enjoy working at the intersection of backend and frontend development, ensuring seamless integrations and efficient workflows.
        Currently, I'm focused on building and optimizing software solutions that enhance user experiences while maintaining clean, well-structured code. Whether it's architecting APIs, refining CI/CD pipelines, or writing efficient unit tests, I aim to balance performance, security, and usability.
        Outside of coding, you'll find me training for the Southampton marathon, fine-tuning my fitness goals, or exploring new technologies. When Iâ€™m not running or debugging, I might be diving into a good book, experimenting with automation, or enjoying a well-earned hot chocolate!</p>
