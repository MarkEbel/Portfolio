      <h1>Leading My First Retrospective</h1>
      <p>
        Leading my first sprint retro was definitely a bit nerve-wracking, but I managed to run it solo and got some great feedback! 
        The team found it useful, especially since previous retros weren’t very productive.
      </p>
      <p>
        I focused on setting <strong>SMART</strong> actions and found topics to focus on next time. 
        Overall, it went well, and I’ll be running these monthly now!
